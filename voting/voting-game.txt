The voting game.

This is a simulation of the Guthrie voting method which is currently being developed.
The game is to investigate what might happen in an election.
The players are the candidates.
Guthrie voting has a general election where voters vote for one candidate.
Every candidate ranks the other candidatess by most favorite to least.
After the votes are cast, the candidates get together to negotiate who wins as defined below.

How to play:

Step 1) Every candidate is assigned a two digit number from 10 to 99.
This represents the number of votes the candidate received in the election.
Be realistic.
Maybe agree numbers should add to something convenient - like 100.
Maybe have a steal session where whichever player who has not yet swapped and has the lowest number
may swap it for any other player's number.

Step 2) Every candidate creates a ranking of the other candidates.
The rankings must be realistic.
Every candidate ranks themselves first.
It is suggested 2 players (A and D) are chosen to be the extremists.
They agree on a rank order.
A > B > C > D for A.
and the reverse D > C > B > A for D.
The other players rank each other any way they wish.

Step 3) Dry run.
Resolve the election where candidates must vote according to their fixed ranking list.

Step 4) Actual result.
Resolve the election where candidates may vote any way they wish.

Resolving the election is done in rounds.
Each round has two phases.
For the actual result, the candidates negotiate between phases.
When candidates vote they cast as many votes as they received in the general election.

Phase 1) Candidates vote for their current favorite candidate.
In the first round, this will be themselves.
If any candidate has a majority of the first place votes, they win. Game over.

Phase 2) Candidates vote against their current least favorite candidate.
If any candidate has a majority of the last place votes, they are removed from the ballots
but they continue to participate.
In the dry run, if no candidate has a majority of the last place votes, then the candidate
with the most last place votes is removed from the ballots.
For the final result, if no candidate has a majorty of the last place votes, then the candidates
negotiate and re-vote until a candidate is eliminated.

Example:
vote counts: A=42, B=26, C=15, D=17
majority = 51.
rankings:
A: B > C > D
B: C > D > A
C: D > B > A
D: C > B > A
Round 1 Phase 1:
A = 42 (from A)
B = 26 (from B)
C = 15 (from C)
D = 17 (from D)
no majority
Round 1 Phase 2:
A = 26 (from B) + 15 (from C) + 17 (from D) = 58
B = 0
C = 0
D = 42 (from A)
A has majority and is eliminated.
new rankings:
A: B > C > D
B: C > D
C: D > B
D: C > B
Round 2 Phase 1:
A = 0
B = 42 (from A) + 26 (from B) = 58
C = 15 (from C)
D = 17 (from D)
B has majority and wins.
