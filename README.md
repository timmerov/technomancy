# technomancy

## general

to build all targets:

$ ./make-unix64.sh

build for windows is not supported.

## spheregen

generate a sphere-ized cube obj file with texture coordinates.

$ ./build-unix64-debug/spheregen/spheregen_d -n 10 -o sphere10.obj

the cube faces are subdivided by the specified number of segments in each direction. the intersection is projected to the surface of a unit sphere. the subdivisions are chosen so the patches on the sphere surface are close to the same size. patches are triangulated by connecting the closest pair of corners.

## convert a polar coordinates texture to a sphere-ized cube texture

in polar coordinates, areas near the poles are stretched horizontally. a sphere-ized cube texture is 25% smaller.

output is a texture suitable for the sphere-ized cube generated by spheregen.

$ ./build-unix64-debug/polar2cube/polar2cube_d -i data/polar.png -o cube.png

the resulting image is oversampled 16x. and can be a bit blurry. applying a sharpen filter is advised.


$ gimp cube.png

select the top half of the image.
filter -> enhance -> sharpen
sharpness 50
okay

select the bottom half of the image.
filter -> enhance -> sharpen
sharpness 50
okay

file -> export as
cube-sharp50.png

## spinning world

polar texture from nasa applied to a sphere-ized cube with simple shading.

uses the cube-sharp50.png file generated above.

$ ./build-unix64-debug/world/world_d
